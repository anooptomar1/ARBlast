Augment Reality with Swift and Xcode

Similar to the popular mobile game, Pokemon Go, using Augmented Reality, you can interact with objects in the real world in real time.
In ARBlast, opening the app opens you into the Augment Reality world where you try to find and track down a Fighter Jet, then Blast it by hitting it with your hand. Or finger, to keep it more friendly.
